This is a basic Python OOP Black Jack game. It was created as a Coding Temple Elite 100 class project, so hashtag comments may still be present in the code.

***********

The rules in this version:

Coding Nannah's Black Jack Game consists of two players: the Dealer (sometimes "House") and the Player. The game consists of a deck of 52 cards of 4 different suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. For each suit, card include: 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A). Facecards (J, Q, K) are valued at 10. Player may choose to make Aces worth 11 or 1. There are no wild cards in this game.

When the game begins, Dealer shuffles the deck, randomizing the cards. After the shuffle, Dealer deals two cards to Player and House. House has one card facedown and the other faceup. Player sees both of his/her own cards but only House's faceup card.

A Blackjack win may be achieved by Player only during the first deal, when Dealer has dealt a total of card value 21 to Player with just two cards. 

If Player did not receive 21 on the first deal, s/he may choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (stay with current card value and receive no more cards). Player may hit as many times as s/he wishes. But beware, Player may go "bust" (over 21 card value), which is an automatic loss. 

When Player chooses to stand, Dealer deals House cards up to the minimum faceup value of 17. Then, all House cards are revealed and the value calculated for Player and House to determine a winner. 

Winner is the one closest to 21 without going bust.

A Tie goes to the dealer.

At this time, there is no betting and therefore, no double-downs, insurance, or splits.

There is also no more than one Player. 

Future plans may include a four-player game and a point system. 

Meanwhile, adapting this to a GUI version (TKinter or HTTP/CSS/JS),creating a StarWars version (Star Wars cards), and adapting for a children's version (juvenile cards) are priorities.
